<h2 id="1-title-required">1. Title (Required)</h2>
<h5 id="definition">DEFINITION:</h5>
<p>A word, phrase, character or group of characters that names the resource being described.</p>
<h5 id="guidelines-for-creating-values-for-the-title-element">GUIDELINES for creating values for the TITLE element</h5>
<p>Titles may be <strong>transcribed</strong>  or <strong>supplied</strong>. A transcribed title appears on the resource. If there is no title inscribed on the resource, a title may be constructed by the metadata contributor, supplied by the creator or the owning institution, or taken from a reference work or another reliable source. It is not necessary to supply square brackets to signify that a supplied title was not taken from the resource.</p>
<p>Do not include initial definite or indefinite articles in the title. Use standard American-style capitalization.</p>
<pre><code>EXAMPLES
* Déjeuner sur l’Herbe [example of supplied title]
* Bacot family papers [supplied]
* Sonatas for violin and piano [transcribed]
* Australian aboriginal painting about AIDS [supplied]
* 1965 cityscape of Los Angeles looking northwest toward Santa Monica Mountains [supplied]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="2-filename-identifiers">2. Filename &amp; Identifiers</h2>
<h4 id="filename-required">Filename (Required)</h4>
<p>The filename of the object (ex. arce_0001.tiff) is recorded in the "<strong>Filename</strong>" field. For file naming best practices, see the the "<a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/ideptoolkit/filenaming.html">File Naming &amp; Organization Guide</a>."</p>
<h4 id="identifier">Identifier</h4>
<p>An <strong>Identifier</strong> is a universal identifier such as ISBN, ISSN, DOI, or an OCLC number.</p>
<h4 id="local-id-recommended">Local ID (Recommended)</h4>
<p>A <strong>Local ID</strong> is any identifier assigned locally. This can be a shelf-mark, item or catalog number, or in some cases the filename without the extension (ex. arce_0001).</p>
<h2 id="3-creator-contributor">3. Creator / Contributor</h2>
<p>The <strong>CREATOR</strong> element is <strong>required</strong> (if known), while the CONTRIBUTOR element is recommended.</p>
<h5 id="definition_1">DEFINITION:</h5>
<p>CREATOR: The entity or entities primarily responsible for making the content of the resource (i.e. author, photographer, artist, etc). This element is required if the creator of a resource is known.</p>
<p>CONTRIBUTOR: Those responsible for making contributions to the intellectual or artistic content, or the physical production and dissemination, of the resource (i.e. publisher, translator, editor, distributor, etc.).</p>
<h5 id="guidelines-for-creating-values-for-the-creator-and-contributor-elements">GUIDELINES for creating values for the CREATOR and CONTRIBUTOR elements</h5>
<p>It is preferred to take the creator or contributor's name from a standard naming authority file. For IDEP collections, the preferred authority is the <a href="https://viaf.org">Virtual International Authority File</a> (VIAF). If the name is not found in VIAF, other authority files, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF), Union List of Artists’ Names (ULAN), or another national authority can be used. If a name does not appear in an authority file, you may establish it in the spreadsheet using the form 'LASTname, FIRSTname'.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Authority</strong> column, indicate the code for the authority source from which the name was taken (VIAF, LCNAF, ULAN, etc.). If the name does not appear in an authority file, the source code should be "<strong>local</strong>". </p>
<p>In the case of multiple creators and/or contributors (of the same type), enter each name separated by " / " in the cell. For multiple contributor types (1 editor, 1 translator), enter the names into separate CONTRIBUTOR columns. Contributor columns must be qualified to indicate the role played (i.e. publisher, editor, etc.). There are a few options available in the template pull-down menu. If these do not accurately reflect the role, you may consult the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html">MARC Code List: Relator codes</a> or the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANRolePopup">ULAN role table</a>.</p>
<p>If CREATOR is unknown, metadata contributors are strongly encouraged to make use of the <strong>CONTRIBUTOR</strong> element.</p>
<pre><code>EXAMPLES (Creator)
* Master of Saint Francis (Italian, active 2nd half of 13th century) [example of artist’s name from ULAN]
* Big Deal Design (Firm) [designer’s name from LCNAF]
* Unknown Tahitian artist [artist’s name from local authority file (created according to CCO guidelines)]
</code></pre>

<pre><code>EXAMPLES (Contributor)
* Landsforeningen for bøsser og lesbiske [publisher, from LCNAF]
* Dickinson, John [designer, from ULAN]

</ul>
<h2 id="4-publisher-place-recommended">4. Publisher place (Recommended)</h2>
<h5 id="definition_2">DEFINITION:</h5>
<p>The name of the place where a resource has been published. (The name of the publisher itself is recorded in the <strong>Contributor</strong> element.)</p>
<h5 id="guidelines-for-creating-values-for-the-publisher-place-element">GUIDELINES for creating values for the PUBLISHER PLACE element</h5>
<p>The form of the place name should be taken from the object. When the object does not provide a place, use a standard naming authority file, such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) or the Library of Congress Name Authority file (LCNAF).</p>
<pre><code>EXAMPLES
* Copenhagen (Denmark) [from LCNAF]
* Copenhagen [from TGN (preferred name in English)]

</ul>
<h2 id="5-date-required">5. Date (Required)</h2>
<h5 id="definition_3">DEFINITION:</h5>
<p>A point or period of time associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource (e.g., creation, publication, printing, restoration, etc. ).</p>
<h5 id="guidelines-for-creating-values-for-the-date-element">GUIDELINES for creating values for the DATE element</h5>
<p>Date information can be derived from the resource itself, or any reliable source, such as documentation related to the resource, etc. Where exact dates are unknown, metadata contributors should provide a range of possible dates for the resource, such as the decade or century in which it was created or published. Use the Description element to describe uncertainty when necessary.</p>
<p>When multiple types of dates are associated with a resource and not all of them are practical to record, the priority should be the type(s) that are most important to users. For example, the date a building was built is probably more important than the date it was photographed or the date the photo was digitized.</p>
<p>Metadata contributors should provide dates to an appropriate level of specificity for the resource. If an exact date or time for the resource is known, it should be provided.</p>
<h5 id="dates-must-be-provided-in-two-formats">Dates must be provided in two formats:</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display date:</strong> suitable for display, i.e. "August 26, 2016"</li>
<li><strong>Normalized date:</strong> allows for machine processing (e.g. search limiting, results sorting). The normalized date follows the format YYYY-MM-DD - for example, "2016-08-26".</li>

<h2 id="7-type-required">7. Type (Required)</h2>
<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
<p>The nature or genre of the content of the resource. To describe the file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource, use the Physical Description element.</p>
<p><strong>GUIDELINES for creating values for the TYPE element</strong></p>
<p><em>Always include qualifiers for this element.</em></p>
<p>Required qualifiers:</p>
<p><strong>Type.collection</strong> – Choose one of two values:</p>
<ul>
<li>yes – Record is for a collection of resources</li>
<li>no – Record is for a single resource</li>

<p><strong>Type.genre</strong> – A category characterizing a particular style, form, or content, such as artistic, musical literary composition, etc. This qualifier allows for more specificity than terms used in Type.typeOfResource. Use a controlled vocabulary (Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online (AAT) preferred) where possible; otherwise identify the term as a local heading.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<pre><code>* Type.collection: yes Type.manuscript: yes [Record for a collection of digitized manuscripts.]

The form of the place name should be taken from a standard naming authority file, for IDEP we recommend Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). If the name does not appear in an authority file, establish the name according to a content standard such as AACR2 or CCO.</p>
<p>IDEP uses a hierarchical form for place names, utilizing separate columns for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject.country</strong></li>
<li><strong>Subject.city</strong></li>
<li><strong>Subject.place</strong> (for specific locations within a city, region, or country)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong>  </p>
<pre><code>* Acequia Madre de Santa Barbara [geographic location, from TGN]  
* Iran [country, from TGN]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="d-topic">D. Topic</h3>
<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
<p>A description or interpretation of the topics, activities, events, ideas or objects that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource. In the case of images, use the Subject element to capture both what the resource is about  (concept), and what it is of  (descriptive), as applicable.</p>
<p><strong>GUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element</strong></p>
<p>The form of the subject term should be taken from a standard subject thesaurus, such as LCSH, MeSH, AAT or TGM.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<pre><code>* Fruit crate labels [descriptive topic, from TGM]
* Depression (Mental state) [concept topic, from TGM]
* Regional planning [concept topic, from LCSH]
* antimacassars [descriptive topic, from AAT]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="13-relation-recommended">13. Relation (Recommended)</h2>
<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
<p>A reference to a related resource. (Note: For objects that are part of digital collections, the Relation -- between the object and the collection that it is part of -- is created automatically.)</p>
<p><strong>GUIDELINES for creating values for the RELATION element</strong></p>
<p><em>This element should always be qualified.</em></p>
<p>Recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system, when possible.</p>
<p>Relationships may be expressed reciprocally (if the resources on both ends of the relationship are being described) or in one direction only, even when there is a refinement available to allow reciprocity. If free text is used instead of a formal string or identifying numbers, the reference should be appropriately specific. For instance, a formal bibliographic citation might be used to point users to a particular resource.</p>
<pre><code>EXAMPLES
* Relation.hasVersion: IFDC report (Spanish edition) [example of a version in another edition, language, etc.]
* Relation.hasFormat: CD-ROM version: Health literacy. Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press, c2004.
* Relation.derivedFrom: Michelangelo Buonarroti, 1475-1564. Creation of Adam. [example of a work inspired by this painting]

<h2 id="14-source-recommended">14. Source (Recommended)</h2>
<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
<p>A related resource from which the described resource is derived, in whole or in part. This element may also include information about the ownership or custodial history of the object.</p>
<p><strong>GUIDELINES for creating values for the SOURCE element</strong></p>
<p>Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system, when possible. In general, include in this area information about a resource that is related intellectually to the described resource but does not fit easily into a Relation element.</p>
<p>Information about the location of discovery or excavation of the object should be entered in either the <strong>Subject</strong> or the <strong>Coverage.Spatial</strong> element of the record.</p>
<p>Source will not normally be used for born digital objects.</p>
<pre><code>EXAMPLES
* BM XV cent., II, p. 346 (IB.5874)
* Smithsonian Archives Record Unit 54, Joseph Henry Collection, 1808, 1825-1878, Box 1, Folder 6, Item 3
