# IDEP Metadata Guidelines

Part of the IDEP Partners Toolkit: [uclalibrary.github.io/ideptoolkit](uclalibrary.github.io/ideptoolkit)

The Guidelines for Descriptive Metadata for the UCLA International Digital Ephemera Project (IDEP) provide descriptive metadata specifications for IDEP partner institutions, with the intent of establishing a common understanding and set of practices across all IDEP collections. Following these guidelines will result in consistent metadata that accurately and adequately describes IDEP collections, facilitates federated searching, and is readily shareable between institutions.

These guidelines seek to provide concrete and specific recommendations wherever possible. However, there are often choices to be made and there is a spectrum of possibilities ranging from the acceptable to the ideal. In addition, the guidelines are meant to apply to a broad range of metadata formats and resource types. In following these guidelines, metadata contributors will be describing both the original object and the digital surrogate of the original object in various parts of the record.

It takes time and effort to create quality, shareable metadata, but there are many benefits:

* Increasing exposure of resources in our collection within the IDEP platform and beyond.
* Providing greater context for resources in the collection.
* Maximizing access to research collections which might otherwise remain unseen.
* Affording opportunities for end-users to make connections between resources across different collections.

Since metadata contributors may not have the time or resources to conform to all of the recommendations, these guidelines are structured into two sections:

* Required metadata elements: these elements must be supplied for all digital objects or collections submitted to IDEP.
* Recommended metadata elements: these elements are not mandatory, but if provided they will greatly increase the discoverability of the resources and provide contextualized information that helps end users evaluate and understand the results of their search.
* 
Additionally, the Digital Library can build more robust services (such as advanced search features) around richer metadata. If metadata contributors are unable to provide the recommended elements themselves, we encourage them to consult with the UCLA Digital Library and/or collaborate with other partners to add to or enhance the records.
