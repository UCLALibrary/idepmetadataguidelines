            "text": "IDEP Metadata Guidelines\n\n\nPart of the IDEP Partners Toolkit: \nuclalibrary.github.io/ideptoolkit\n\n\nThe Guidelines for Descriptive Metadata for the UCLA International Digital Ephemera Project (IDEP) provide descriptive metadata specifications for IDEP partner institutions, with the intent of establishing a common understanding and set of practices across all IDEP collections. Following these guidelines will result in consistent metadata that accurately and adequately describes IDEP collections, facilitates federated searching, and is readily shareable between institutions.\n\n\nThese guidelines seek to provide concrete and specific recommendations wherever possible. However, there are often choices to be made and there is a spectrum of possibilities ranging from the acceptable to the ideal. In addition, the guidelines are meant to apply to a broad range of metadata formats and resource types. In following these guidelines, metadata contributors will be describing both the original object and the digital surrogate of the original object in various parts of the record.\n\n\nIt takes time and effort to create quality, shareable metadata, but there are many benefits:\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing exposure of resources in our collection within the IDEP platform and beyond.\n\n\nProviding greater context for resources in the collection.\n\n\nMaximizing access to research collections which might otherwise remain unseen.\n\n\nAffording opportunities for end-users to make connections between resources across different collections.\n\n\n\n\nSince metadata contributors may not have the time or resources to conform to all of the recommendations, these guidelines are structured into two sections:\n\n\n\n\nRequired metadata elements: these elements must be supplied for all digital objects or collections submitted to IDEP.\n\n\nRecommended metadata elements: these elements are not mandatory, but if provided they will greatly increase the discoverability of the resources and provide contextualized information that helps end users evaluate and understand the results of their search.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Digital Library can build more robust services (such as advanced search features) around richer metadata. If metadata contributors are unable to provide the recommended elements themselves, we encourage them to consult with the UCLA Digital Library and/or collaborate with other partners to add to or enhance the records.\n\n\n\n\nMetadata Template\n\n\nMetadata for IDEP collections should be submitted to the UCLA Digital Library in spreadsheet form. To facilitate this process, the UCLA Digital Library has created the Metadata Spreadsheet Template that can be used as a starting point for collecting and recording metadata that describe IDEP collections. The spreadsheet includes pre-formatted columns for \nRequired \n(*) and \nRecommended\n fields, along with descriptions, links to resources, and instructions for use.\n\n\nThe Metadata Spreadsheet Template also includes templates (tabs) for specific types of resources (Books, Serials, and Archival Collections). The templates in these tabs are based on the original (General) sheet, but have been edited to address the metadata needs of the specific resource types and should be used when applicable.\nIn some cases, a selection of values has been pre-filled, allowing for selection of the appropriate value from a pull-down menu. If one of the pre-filled values does not accurately describe the object, you may fill in a new value; however, most cases will be covered by the existing values.\n\n\nTo make it easier to refer back to this guide, descriptions for each of the fields include links pointing back to the relevant Descriptive Term outlined in this guide. For example, in the description for the column \"Title\", there is a link pointing back to the Descriptive Term Summary for \"Title\" in this guide.\n\n\nCreating metadata can be daunting for some at the outset, but the UCLA Digital Library will work with partners to identify the relevant descriptive terms and values that best describe their IDEP collections and to further customize these templates to meet collection needs.\n\n\nMetadata Spreadsheet Template: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nEIsORvcOvL3xOH_CJEbPJGeb6Etj_Qbj-vF_ROgB0M/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nDescriptive Terms\n\n\nName Authorities:\n\n\n\n\nVirtual International Authority File\n (VIAF)\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Name Authority File\n (LCNAF)\n\n\nUnion List of Artists\u2019 Names\n (ULAN)\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Standards:\n\n\n\n\nAnglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2)\n\n\nCataloging Cultural Objects (CCO)\n\n\nDescribing Archives: a Content Standard (DACS)\n\n\n\n\n1. Title (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA word, phrase, character or group of characters that names the resource being described.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the TITLE element\n\n\nTitles may be \ntranscribed\n  or \nsupplied\n. A transcribed title appears on the resource. If there is no title inscribed on the resource, a title may be constructed by the metadata contributor, supplied by the creator or the owning institution, or taken from a reference work or another reliable source. It is not necessary to supply square brackets to signify that a supplied title was not taken from the resource.\n\n\nDo not include initial definite or indefinite articles in the title. Use standard American-style capitalization.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019Herbe [example of supplied title]\n* Bacot family papers [supplied]\n* Sonatas for violin and piano [transcribed]\n* Australian aboriginal painting about AIDS [supplied]\n* 1965 cityscape of Los Angeles looking northwest toward Santa Monica Mountains [supplied]\n\n\n\n\n2. Filename \n Identifiers\n\n\nFilename (Required)\n\n\nThe filename of the object (ex. arce_0001.tiff) is recorded in the \"\nFilename\n\" field. For file naming best practices, see the the \"\nFile Naming \n Organization Guide\n.\"\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\nAn \nIdentifier\n is a universal identifier such as ISBN, ISSN, DOI, or an OCLC number.\n\n\nLocal ID (Recommended)\n\n\nA \nLocal ID\n is any identifier assigned locally. This can be a shelf-mark, item or catalog number, or in some cases the filename without the extension (ex. arce_0001).\n\n\n3. Creator / Contributor\n\n\nThe \nCREATOR\n element is \nrequired\n (if known), while the CONTRIBUTOR element is recommended.\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nCREATOR: The entity or entities primarily responsible for making the content of the resource (i.e. author, photographer, artist, etc). This element is required if the creator of a resource is known.\n\n\nCONTRIBUTOR: Those responsible for making contributions to the intellectual or artistic content, or the physical production and dissemination, of the resource (i.e. publisher, translator, editor, distributor, etc.).\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the CREATOR and CONTRIBUTOR elements\n\n\nIt is preferred to take the creator or contributor's name from a standard naming authority file. For IDEP collections, the preferred authority is the \nVirtual International Authority File\n (VIAF). If the name is not found in VIAF, other authority files, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF), Union List of Artists\u2019 Names (ULAN), or another national authority can be used. If a name does not appear in an authority file, you may establish it in the spreadsheet using the form 'LASTname, FIRSTname'.\n\n\nIn the \nAuthority\n column, indicate the code for the authority source from which the name was taken (VIAF, LCNAF, ULAN, etc.). If the name does not appear in an authority file, the source code should be \"\nlocal\n\". \n\n\nIn the case of multiple creators and/or contributors (of the same type), enter each name separated by \" / \" in the cell. For multiple contributor types (1 editor, 1 translator), enter the names into separate CONTRIBUTOR columns. Contributor columns must be qualified to indicate the role played (i.e. publisher, editor, etc.). There are a few options available in the template pull-down menu. If these do not accurately reflect the role, you may consult the \nMARC Code List: Relator codes\n or the \nULAN role table\n.\n\n\nIf CREATOR is unknown, metadata contributors are strongly encouraged to make use of the \nCONTRIBUTOR\n element.\n\n\nEXAMPLES (Creator)\n* Master of Saint Francis (Italian, active 2nd half of 13th century) [example of artist\u2019s name from ULAN]\n* Big Deal Design (Firm) [designer\u2019s name from LCNAF]\n* Unknown Tahitian artist [artist\u2019s name from local authority file (created according to CCO guidelines)]\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES (Contributor)\n* Landsforeningen for b\u00f8sser og lesbiske [publisher, from LCNAF]\n* Dickinson, John [designer, from ULAN]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\nName Authority Files:\n\n\n\n\nVirtual International Authority File\n (VIAF) - \nPreferred\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Name Authority File\n (LCNAF)\n\n\nUnion List of Artists\u2019 Names\n (ULAN)\n\n\n\n\n4. Publisher place (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nThe name of the place where a resource has been published. (The name of the publisher itself is recorded in the \nContributor\n element.)\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the PUBLISHER PLACE element\n\n\nThe form of the place name should be taken from the object. When the object does not provide a place, use a standard naming authority file, such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) or the Library of Congress Name Authority file (LCNAF).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* Copenhagen (Denmark) [from LCNAF]\n* Copenhagen [from TGN (preferred name in English)]\n\n\n\n\nStandards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nThesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Name Authority file (LCNAF\n)\n\n\n\n\n5. Date (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA point or period of time associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource (e.g., creation, publication, printing, restoration, etc. ).\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the DATE element\n\n\nDate information can be derived from the resource itself, or any reliable source, such as documentation related to the resource, etc. Where exact dates are unknown, metadata contributors should provide a range of possible dates for the resource, such as the decade or century in which it was created or published. Use the Description element to describe uncertainty when necessary.\n\n\nWhen multiple types of dates are associated with a resource and not all of them are practical to record, the priority should be the type(s) that are most important to users. For example, the date a building was built is probably more important than the date it was photographed or the date the photo was digitized.\n\n\nMetadata contributors should provide dates to an appropriate level of specificity for the resource. If an exact date or time for the resource is known, it should be provided.\n\n\nDates must be provided in two formats:\n\n\n\n\nDisplay date:\n suitable for display, i.e. \"August 26, 2016\"\n\n\nNormalized date:\n allows for machine processing (e.g. search limiting, results sorting). The normalized date follows the format YYYY-MM-DD - for example, \"2016-08-26\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nDisplay date\n\n\nNormalized date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear of publication\n\n\n1965\n\n\n1965\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange of possible years\n\n\nBetween 1967 and 1985\n\n\n1967/1985\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate span\n\n\n1993-1995\n\n\n1993/1995\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExact date\n\n\nOctober 26, 1969\n\n\n1969-10-26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentury\n\n\n19th century\n\n\n1801/1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated date\n\n\nJuly or August 1991\n\n\n1991-07/1991-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nW3C: Date and time formats\n\n\n\n\n6. Language (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA designation of the language in which the content of the resource is expressed, or which is primary to understanding the resource. (Note: Not the language of the metadata record itself.)\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the LANGUAGE element\n\n\nUse the ISO 639-3 code for the language of the resource (see below).\n\n\nIf non-textual, code as '\nzxx\n'  (no linguistic content). If language cannot be determined, code as '\nund\n'  (a language that cannot be determined).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* ara [Arabic]\n* eng [English]\n* jpn [Japanese]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nCodes for the representation of names of languages (ISO 639-3)\n\n\n\n\n7. Type (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nThe nature or genre of the content of the resource. To describe the file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource, use the Physical Description element.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the TYPE element\n\n\nAlways include qualifiers for this element.\n\n\nRequired qualifiers:\n\n\nType.collection\n \u2013 Choose one of two values:\n\n\n\n\nyes \u2013 Record is for a collection of resources\n\n\nno \u2013 Record is for a single resource\n\n\n\n\nType.manuscript\n \u2013 Choose one of two values:\n\n\n\n\nyes \u2013 Resource being described is a manuscript\n\n\nno \u2013 Resource being described is not a manuscript\n\n\n\n\nType.typeOfResource\n \u2013 The general type of content of the resource. The metadata template contains a pull-down menu of the acceptable terms (text, still image, cartographic, sound recording, moving image, etc.)\n\n\nType.genre\n \u2013 A category characterizing a particular style, form, or content, such as artistic, musical literary composition, etc. This qualifier allows for more specificity than terms used in Type.typeOfResource. Use a controlled vocabulary (Art \n Architecture Thesaurus Online (AAT) preferred) where possible; otherwise identify the term as a local heading.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Type.collection: yes Type.manuscript: yes [Record for a collection of digitized manuscripts.]\n* Type.collection: yes Type.manuscript: no [Record for a collection of digitized posters.]\n* Type.collection: no Type.manuscript: yes [Record for a single digitized document (on its own, or as part of a larger collection).]\n* Type.collection: no Type.manuscript: no [Record for a single digitized poster (on its own, or as part of a larger collection).]\n* Type.typeOfResource: still image [from MODS]\n* Type.typeOfResource: sound recording [from MODS]\n* Type.genre: posters [from AAT]\n* Type.genre: Periodicals [from BGTCHM]\n* Type.genre: Spaghetti Westerns [from LCSH]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\nFor \nType.genre:\n\n\n\n\n Art \n Architecture Thesaurus Online (AAT)\n (preferred)\n\n\nBasic Genre Terms for Cultural Heritage Materials (BGTCHM)\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)\n\n\nRare Books and Manuscripts Section Controlled Vocabularies (RBMS)\n\n\nThesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM)\n\n\n\n\n8. Physical Description\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nThe physical medium, extent, or dimensions of the resource. This element is known in some metadata schemas as \"format.\"\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION element\n\n\nThe Physical Description element may be used to record information about the resource: extent, dimensions, and medium.\n\n\nPhysicalDescription.extent\n (Required ) -- Number of items, number of pages, or duration (length, such as seconds) of the resource. (May be the same whether referring to the original resource or the digital object.)\n\n\nPhysicalDescription.dimensions\n (Recommended) -- The measurements of the original resource, including its size or scale.\n\n\nPhysicalDescription.medium\n (Recommended) -- The material or physical carrier of the resource (i.e. the materials of which the resource is composed).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* PhysicalDescription.extent: 1 postcard\n* PhysicalDescription.dimensions: 61 x 43 cm.

Description (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nAn account of the content of the resource, and other descriptive information about the resource. Description may include information such as an abstract, table of contents, or a free-text account of the content.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the DESCRIPTION element\n\n\nUse qualifiers to distinguish different types of Description (e.g. .abstract, .inscription, .note, etc.). Be judicious in using this element; important information about the resource should be captured in other elements if appropriate.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Description.note: Date on back of poster, 1997, reflects when the vendor received the copy later acquired by the UCLA Library.\n* Description.inscription: \nLonghaired\n Palisades High School students protest school's demand that they get hair cut.

Subject (Recommended)\n\n\nAny of the topics or themes of a work, stated explicitly in the resource or its title or implicitly in its content. Subjects can be persons or organizations, other resources, places, or topics.\n\n\nA. Persons / organizations\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nSignificant names (personal, corporate, family, meeting) that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\n\nPrefer taking the name from a standard naming authority file, such as VIAF, or other sources such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF) or Union List of Artists\u2019 Names (ULAN). If a name does not appear in an authority file, establish it according to a content standard such as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO), or Describing Archives: a Content Standard (DACS).\n\n\nWhen establishing the name, indicate the code for the source from which the name was taken (LCNAF, ULAN, etc.). If the name does not appear in an authority file, the source code should be \"local.\"\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Antoniani, Pietro [artist, from ULAN]\n* Antoniani, Pietro, | d ca. 1740-1805 [artist, from LCNAF]\n* Institute without Boundaries [corporate name, from LCNAF]\n\n\n\n\nB. Titles\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nSignificant titles of other resources (e.g. works, expressions of those works, individual items, etc.) that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\n\nThe form of the title should be taken from a standard naming authority file, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File, which contains uniform titles (LCNAF). If the title does not appear in an authority file, establish the title according to a content standard such as AACR2, CCO, or DACS.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Bible. O.T. Psalms [uniform title, from LCNAF]\n* Maha bha rata [uniform title, from LCNAF]\n\n\n\n\nC. Place\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nSignificant names of geographic locations that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\nThe form of the place name should be taken from a standard naming authority file, for IDEP we recommend Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). If the name does not appear in an authority file, establish the name according to a content standard such as AACR2 or CCO.\n\n\nIDEP uses a hierarchical form for place names, utilizing separate columns for:\n\n\n\n\nSubject.country\n\n\nSubject.city\n\n\nSubject.place\n (for specific locations within a city, region, or country)\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n  \n\n\n* Acequia Madre de Santa Barbara [geographic location, from TGN]  \n* Iran [country, from TGN]\n\n\n\n\nD. Topic\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA description or interpretation of the topics, activities, events, ideas or objects that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource. In the case of images, use the Subject element to capture both what the resource is about  (concept), and what it is of  (descriptive), as applicable.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\n\nThe form of the subject term should be taken from a standard subject thesaurus, such as LCSH, MeSH, AAT or TGM.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Fruit crate labels [descriptive topic, from TGM]\n* Depression (Mental state) [concept topic, from TGM]\n* Regional planning [concept topic, from LCSH]\n* antimacassars [descriptive topic, from AAT]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nCataloging Cultural Objects (CCO)\n\n\nSubject Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings (5th Edition)\n\n\n\n\n13. Relation (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA reference to a related resource. (Note: For objects that are part of digital collections, the Relation -- between the object and the collection that it is part of -- is created automatically.)\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the RELATION element\n\n\nThis element should always be qualified.\n\n\nRecommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system, when possible.\n\n\nRelationships may be expressed reciprocally (if the resources on both ends of the relationship are being described) or in one direction only, even when there is a refinement available to allow reciprocity. If free text is used instead of a formal string or identifying numbers, the reference should be appropriately specific. For instance, a formal bibliographic citation might be used to point users to a particular resource.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* Relation.hasVersion: IFDC report (Spanish edition) [example of a version in another edition, language, etc.]\n* Relation.hasFormat: CD-ROM version: Health literacy. Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press, c2004.\n* Relation.derivedFrom: Michelangelo Buonarroti, 1475-1564. Creation of Adam. [example of a work inspired by this painting]\n\n\n\n\n14. Source (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA related resource from which the described resource is derived, in whole or in part. This element may also include information about the ownership or custodial history of the object.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SOURCE element\n\n\nRecommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system, when possible. In general, include in this area information about a resource that is related intellectually to the described resource but does not fit easily into a Relation element.\n\n\nInformation about the location of discovery or excavation of the object should be entered in either the \nSubject\n or the \nCoverage.Spatial\n element of the record.\n\n\nSource will not normally be used for born digital objects.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* BM XV cent., II, p. 346 (IB.5874)\n* Smithsonian Archives Record Unit 54, Joseph Henry Collection, 1808, 1825-1878, Box 1, Folder 6, Item 3\n\n\n\n\nGlossary\n\n\nHere you will find a selection of terms used in the guidelines and their explanations.\n\n\nauthority file\n: A list of authoritative forms of headings (names, subjects, etc.), used to make sure that headings are applied consistently. Usually relates to the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) or the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF).\n\n\ncontent standard\n: Guidelines for the format, syntax and content of the values entered in metadata elements. Examples: Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules/Resource Description and Access (AACR2/RDA), International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO), Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS).\n\n\ncontrolled vocabulary\n: An established set of preferred terms, used to provide consistency in resource description and retrieval.\n\n\ndescriptive metadata\n: Data about resources and digital objects that is intended to improve their discovery and identification, and establish relationships between different resources.\n\n\nelement\n: A discrete component of metadata, such as Title, Date, Format, etc., which describes properties of a resource. Elements may be qualified.\n\n\nmetadata\n: Literally, data about data. In this context, data about resources and digital objects.\n\n\nobject\n: The digital surrogate or manifestation of the original resource. If the something is born-digital, the object has no original for which it is a surrogate.\n\n\nproperty\n: Specific attributes, characteristics or relations used to describe or provide context for a resource.\n\n\nqualifier\n: Terms used to make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific\n\n\nresource\n: The original entity being described by the record; in other words, the physical or created resource. A collection of resources is also a resource.",

To facilitate this process, the UCLA Digital Library has created the Metadata Spreadsheet Template that can be used as a starting point for collecting and recording metadata that describe IDEP collections. The spreadsheet includes pre-formatted columns for  Required  (*) and  Recommended  fields, along with descriptions, links to resources, and instructions for use.  The Metadata Spreadsheet Template also includes templates (tabs) for specific types of resources (Books, Serials, and Archival Collections). The templates in these tabs are based on the original (General) sheet, but have been edited to address the metadata needs of the specific resource types and should be used when applicable.\nIn some cases, a selection of values has been pre-filled, allowing for selection of the appropriate value from a pull-down menu. If one of the pre-filled values does not accurately describe the object, you may fill in a new value; however, most cases will be covered by the existing values.  To make it easier to refer back to this guide, descriptions for each of the fields include links pointing back to the relevant Descriptive Term outlined in this guide. For example, in the description for the column \"Title\", there is a link pointing back to the Descriptive Term Summary for \"Title\" in this guide.  Creating metadata can be daunting for some at the outset, but the UCLA Digital Library will work with partners to identify the relevant descriptive terms and values that best describe their IDEP collections and to further customize these templates to meet collection needs.

Title (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA word, phrase, character or group of characters that names the resource being described.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the TITLE element\n\n\nTitles may be \ntranscribed\n  or \nsupplied\n. A transcribed title appears on the resource. If there is no title inscribed on the resource, a title may be constructed by the metadata contributor, supplied by the creator or the owning institution, or taken from a reference work or another reliable source. It is not necessary to supply square brackets to signify that a supplied title was not taken from the resource.\n\n\nDo not include initial definite or indefinite articles in the title. Use standard American-style capitalization.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019Herbe [example of supplied title]\n* Bacot family papers [supplied]\n* Sonatas for violin and piano [transcribed]\n* Australian aboriginal painting about AIDS [supplied]\n* 1965 cityscape of Los Angeles looking northwest toward Santa Monica Mountains [supplied]\n\n\n\n\n2. Filename \n Identifiers\n\n\nFilename (Required)\n\n\nThe filename of the object (ex. arce_0001.tiff) is recorded in the \"\nFilename\n\" field. For file naming best practices, see the the \"\nFile Naming \n Organization Guide\n.\"\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\nAn \nIdentifier\n is a universal identifier such as ISBN, ISSN, DOI, or an OCLC number.\n\n\nLocal ID (Recommended)\n\n\nA \nLocal ID\n is any identifier assigned locally. This can be a shelf-mark, item or catalog number, or in some cases the filename without the extension (ex. arce_0001).\n\n\n3. Creator / Contributor\n\n\nThe \nCREATOR\n element is \nrequired\n (if known), while the CONTRIBUTOR element is recommended.\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nCREATOR: The entity or entities primarily responsible for making the content of the resource (i.e. author, photographer, artist, etc). This element is required if the creator of a resource is known.\n\n\nCONTRIBUTOR: Those responsible for making contributions to the intellectual or artistic content, or the physical production and dissemination, of the resource (i.e. publisher, translator, editor, distributor, etc.).\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the CREATOR and CONTRIBUTOR elements\n\n\nIt is preferred to take the creator or contributor's name from a standard naming authority file. For IDEP collections, the preferred authority is the \nVirtual International Authority File\n (VIAF). If the name is not found in VIAF, other authority files, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF), Union List of Artists\u2019 Names (ULAN), or another national authority can be used. If a name does not appear in an authority file, you may establish it in the spreadsheet using the form 'LASTname, FIRSTname'.\n\n\nIn the \nAuthority\n column, indicate the code for the authority source from which the name was taken (VIAF, LCNAF, ULAN, etc.). If the name does not appear in an authority file, the source code should be \"\nlocal\n\". \n\n\nIn the case of multiple creators and/or contributors (of the same type), enter each name separated by \" / \" in the cell. For multiple contributor types (1 editor, 1 translator), enter the names into separate CONTRIBUTOR columns. Contributor columns must be qualified to indicate the role played (i.e. publisher, editor, etc.). There are a few options available in the template pull-down menu. If these do not accurately reflect the role, you may consult the \nMARC Code List: Relator codes\n or the \nULAN role table\n.\n\n\nIf CREATOR is unknown, metadata contributors are strongly encouraged to make use of the \nCONTRIBUTOR\n element.\n\n\nEXAMPLES (Creator)\n* Master of Saint Francis (Italian, active 2nd half of 13th century) [example of artist\u2019s name from ULAN]\n* Big Deal Design (Firm) [designer\u2019s name from LCNAF]\n* Unknown Tahitian artist [artist\u2019s name from local authority file (created according to CCO guidelines)]\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES (Contributor)\n* Landsforeningen for b\u00f8sser og lesbiske [publisher, from LCNAF]\n* Dickinson, John [designer, from ULAN]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\nName Authority Files:\n\n\n\n\nVirtual International Authority File\n (VIAF) - \nPreferred\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Name Authority File\n (LCNAF)\n\n\nUnion List of Artists\u2019 Names\n (ULAN)\n\n\n\n\n4. Publisher place (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nThe name of the place where a resource has been published. (The name of the publisher itself is recorded in the \nContributor\n element.)\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the PUBLISHER PLACE element\n\n\nThe form of the place name should be taken from the object. When the object does not provide a place, use a standard naming authority file, such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) or the Library of Congress Name Authority file (LCNAF).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* Copenhagen (Denmark) [from LCNAF]\n* Copenhagen [from TGN (preferred name in English)]\n\n\n\n\nStandards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nThesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Name Authority file (LCNAF\n)\n\n\n\n\n5. Date (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA point or period of time associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource (e.g., creation, publication, printing, restoration, etc. ).\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the DATE element\n\n\nDate information can be derived from the resource itself, or any reliable source, such as documentation related to the resource, etc. Where exact dates are unknown, metadata contributors should provide a range of possible dates for the resource, such as the decade or century in which it was created or published. Use the Description element to describe uncertainty when necessary.\n\n\nWhen multiple types of dates are associated with a resource and not all of them are practical to record, the priority should be the type(s) that are most important to users. For example, the date a building was built is probably more important than the date it was photographed or the date the photo was digitized.\n\n\nMetadata contributors should provide dates to an appropriate level of specificity for the resource. If an exact date or time for the resource is known, it should be provided.\n\n\nDates must be provided in two formats:\n\n\n\n\nDisplay date:\n suitable for display, i.e. \"August 26, 2016\"\n\n\nNormalized date:\n allows for machine processing (e.g. search limiting, results sorting). The normalized date follows the format YYYY-MM-DD - for example, \"2016-08-26\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nDisplay date\n\n\nNormalized date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear of publication\n\n\n1965\n\n\n1965\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange of possible years\n\n\nBetween 1967 and 1985\n\n\n1967/1985\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate span\n\n\n1993-1995\n\n\n1993/1995\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExact date\n\n\nOctober 26, 1969\n\n\n1969-10-26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentury\n\n\n19th century\n\n\n1801/1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated date\n\n\nJuly or August 1991\n\n\n1991-07/1991-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nW3C: Date and time formats\n\n\n\n\n6. Language (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA designation of the language in which the content of the resource is expressed, or which is primary to understanding the resource. (Note: Not the language of the metadata record itself.)\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the LANGUAGE element\n\n\nUse the ISO 639-3 code for the language of the resource (see below).\n\n\nIf non-textual, code as '\nzxx\n'  (no linguistic content). If language cannot be determined, code as '\nund\n'  (a language that cannot be determined).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* ara [Arabic]\n* eng [English]\n* jpn [Japanese]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nCodes for the representation of names of languages (ISO 639-3)\n\n\n\n\n7. Type (Required)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nThe nature or genre of the content of the resource. To describe the file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource, use the Physical Description element.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the TYPE element\n\n\nAlways include qualifiers for this element.\n\n\nRequired qualifiers:\n\n\nType.collection\n \u2013 Choose one of two values:\n\n\n\n\nyes \u2013 Record is for a collection of resources\n\n\nno \u2013 Record is for a single resource\n\n\n\n\nType.manuscript\n \u2013 Choose one of two values:\n\n\n\n\nyes \u2013 Resource being described is a manuscript\n\n\nno \u2013 Resource being described is not a manuscript\n\n\n\n\nType.typeOfResource\n \u2013 The general type of content of the resource. The metadata template contains a pull-down menu of the acceptable terms (text, still image, cartographic, sound recording, moving image, etc.)\n\n\nType.genre\n \u2013 A category characterizing a particular style, form, or content, such as artistic, musical literary composition, etc. This qualifier allows for more specificity than terms used in Type.typeOfResource. Use a controlled vocabulary (Art \n Architecture Thesaurus Online (AAT) preferred) where possible; otherwise identify the term as a local heading.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Type.collection: yes Type.manuscript: yes [Record for a collection of digitized manuscripts.]\n* Type.collection: yes Type.manuscript: no [Record for a collection of digitized posters.]\n* Type.collection: no Type.manuscript: yes [Record for a single digitized document (on its own, or as part of a larger collection).]\n* Type.collection: no Type.manuscript: no [Record for a single digitized poster (on its own, or as part of a larger collection).]\n* Type.typeOfResource: still image [from MODS]\n* Type.typeOfResource: sound recording [from MODS]\n* Type.genre: posters [from AAT]\n* Type.genre: Periodicals [from BGTCHM]\n* Type.genre: Spaghetti Westerns [from LCSH]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\nFor \nType.genre:\n\n\n\n\n Art \n Architecture Thesaurus Online (AAT)\n (preferred)\n\n\nBasic Genre Terms for Cultural Heritage Materials (BGTCHM)\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)\n\n\nRare Books and Manuscripts Section Controlled Vocabularies (RBMS)\n\n\nThesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM)\n\n\n\n\n8. Physical Description\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nThe physical medium, extent, or dimensions of the resource. This element is known in some metadata schemas as \"format.\"\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION element\n\n\nThe Physical Description element may be used to record information about the resource: extent, dimensions, and medium.\n\n\nPhysicalDescription.extent\n (Required ) -- Number of items, number of pages, or duration (length, such as seconds) of the resource. (May be the same whether referring to the original resource or the digital object.)\n\n\nPhysicalDescription.dimensions\n (Recommended) -- The measurements of the original resource, including its size or scale.\n\n\nPhysicalDescription.medium\n (Recommended) -- The material or physical carrier of the resource (i.e. the materials of which the resource is composed).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* PhysicalDescription.extent: 1 postcard\n* PhysicalDescription.dimensions: 61 x 43 cm.

Description (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nAn account of the content of the resource, and other descriptive information about the resource. Description may include information such as an abstract, table of contents, or a free-text account of the content.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the DESCRIPTION element\n\n\nUse qualifiers to distinguish different types of Description (e.g. .abstract, .inscription, .note, etc.). Be judicious in using this element; important information about the resource should be captured in other elements if appropriate.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Description.note: Date on back of poster, 1997, reflects when the vendor received the copy later acquired by the UCLA Library.\n* Description.inscription: \nLonghaired\n Palisades High School students protest school's demand that they get hair cut.

Persons / organizations\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nSignificant names (personal, corporate, family, meeting) that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\n\nPrefer taking the name from a standard naming authority file, such as VIAF, or other sources such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF) or Union List of Artists\u2019 Names (ULAN). If a name does not appear in an authority file, establish it according to a content standard such as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO), or Describing Archives: a Content Standard (DACS).\n\n\nWhen establishing the name, indicate the code for the source from which the name was taken (LCNAF, ULAN, etc.). If the name does not appear in an authority file, the source code should be \"local.\"\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Antoniani, Pietro [artist, from ULAN]\n* Antoniani, Pietro, | d ca. 1740-1805 [artist, from LCNAF]\n* Institute without Boundaries [corporate name, from LCNAF]\n\n\n\n\nB. Titles\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nSignificant titles of other resources (e.g. works, expressions of those works, individual items, etc.) that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\n\nThe form of the title should be taken from a standard naming authority file, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File, which contains uniform titles (LCNAF).

Psalms [uniform title, from LCNAF]\n* Maha bha rata [uniform title, from LCNAF]\n\n\n\n\nC. Place\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nSignificant names of geographic locations that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\nThe form of the place name should be taken from a standard naming authority file, for IDEP we recommend Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). If the name does not appear in an authority file, establish the name according to a content standard such as AACR2 or CCO.\n\n\nIDEP uses a hierarchical form for place names, utilizing separate columns for:\n\n\n\n\nSubject.country\n\n\nSubject.city\n\n\nSubject.place\n (for specific locations within a city, region, or country)\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n  \n\n\n* Acequia Madre de Santa Barbara [geographic location, from TGN]  \n* Iran [country, from TGN]\n\n\n\n\nD. Topic\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA description or interpretation of the topics, activities, events, ideas or objects that are the subject of, or that are represented in, on or by the resource. In the case of images, use the Subject element to capture both what the resource is about  (concept), and what it is of  (descriptive), as applicable.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SUBJECT element\n\n\nThe form of the subject term should be taken from a standard subject thesaurus, such as LCSH, MeSH, AAT or TGM.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n* Fruit crate labels [descriptive topic, from TGM]\n* Depression (Mental state) [concept topic, from TGM]\n* Regional planning [concept topic, from LCSH]\n* antimacassars [descriptive topic, from AAT]\n\n\n\n\nOther Standards and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nCataloging Cultural Objects (CCO)\n\n\nSubject Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings (5th Edition)\n\n\n\n\n13. Relation (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA reference to a related resource. (Note: For objects that are part of digital collections, the Relation -- between the object and the collection that it is part of -- is created automatically.)\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the RELATION element\n\n\nThis element should always be qualified.\n\n\nRecommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system, when possible.\n\n\nRelationships may be expressed reciprocally (if the resources on both ends of the relationship are being described) or in one direction only, even when there is a refinement available to allow reciprocity. If free text is used instead of a formal string or identifying numbers, the reference should be appropriately specific. For instance, a formal bibliographic citation might be used to point users to a particular resource.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* Relation.hasVersion: IFDC report (Spanish edition) [example of a version in another edition, language, etc.]\n* Relation.hasFormat: CD-ROM version: Health literacy. Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press, c2004.\n* Relation.derivedFrom: Michelangelo Buonarroti, 1475-1564. Creation of Adam. [example of a work inspired by this painting]\n\n\n\n\n14. Source (Recommended)\n\n\nDEFINITION:\n\n\nA related resource from which the described resource is derived, in whole or in part. This element may also include information about the ownership or custodial history of the object.\n\n\nGUIDELINES for creating values for the SOURCE element\n\n\nRecommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system, when possible. In general, include in this area information about a resource that is related intellectually to the described resource but does not fit easily into a Relation element.\n\n\nInformation about the location of discovery or excavation of the object should be entered in either the \nSubject\n or the \nCoverage.Spatial\n element of the record.\n\n\nSource will not normally be used for born digital objects.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n* BM XV cent., II, p. 346 (IB.5874)\n* Smithsonian Archives Record Unit 54, Joseph Henry Collection, 1808, 1825-1878, Box 1, Folder 6, Item 3",

In the case of multiple creators and/or contributors (of the same type), enter each name separated by \" / \" in the cell. For multiple contributor types (1 editor, 1 translator), enter the names into separate CONTRIBUTOR columns. Contributor columns must be qualified to indicate the role played (i.e. publisher, editor, etc.). There are a few options available in the template pull-down menu.
